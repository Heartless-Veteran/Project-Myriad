## Security Best Practices for Contributors

When contributing to Project Myriad:

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use local.properties for sensitive data
2. **Validate all inputs** - Sanitize user inputs and API responses
3. **Use secure APIs** - Prefer Android Keystore and secure random generators
4. **Follow least privilege** - Request minimal permissions necessary
5. **Handle errors securely** - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security Testing

We encourage security testing of Project Myriad:
- **Static Analysis**: Use detekt security rules
- **Dependency Checks**: Run OWASP dependency check
- **Network Testing**: Verify certificate pinning and HTTPS enforcement
