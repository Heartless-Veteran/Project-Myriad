# Workflow Consolidation Summary

## Changes Made

### Problem
- **3 overlapping CI workflows** with redundant functionality:
  - `automated-documentation-quality.yml` - ktlint, detekt, tests, dokka
  - `ci-cd.yml` - build, tests, lint, release  
  - `code-quality.yml` - ktlint, detekt, jacoco, android lint

### Solution
- **Consolidated into single `ci.yml` workflow** with 3 focused jobs:
  - `build-and-quality`: Unified build, test, and quality checks
  - `documentation`: Dokka generation and validation (conditional)
  - `release`: Release APK generation (main branch only)

### Benefits
✅ **Eliminated redundancy** - No more duplicate test/lint execution  
✅ **Faster CI runs** - Optimized job dependencies and caching  
✅ **Consistent environment** - Single JDK/Gradle setup  
✅ **Clear separation** - CI, Security, Release have distinct purposes  

### Preserved Workflows
- `security.yml` - CodeQL, dependency scanning, secret detection
- `release.yml` - Tag-based release automation

### Archived Workflows
- Moved redundant workflows to `.github/workflows/archived/`
- Can be restored if needed for reference

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - NEW consolidated workflow
- `.github/workflows/archived/` - Moved old workflows here
- `docs/AUTOMATED_WORKFLOW.md` - Updated documentation

## Validation
- ✅ Gradle commands tested locally
- ✅ ktlint/detekt commands verified with `--continue` flag
- ✅ Architecture validation script tested
- ✅ Documentation updated to reflect changes
