/**
 * Summary of findings for Issue #56:
 * 
 * This test suite demonstrates that useNativeDriver animations work without warnings
 * in the current test setup, even without an explicit NativeAnimatedHelper mock.
 * 
 * This suggests that either:
 * 1. The react-native-reanimated mock is sufficient to handle useNativeDriver warnings
 * 2. The React Native version (0.81.0) handles this differently than older versions
 * 3. The jest preset 'react-native' includes built-in animation mocking
 * 
 * If warnings were to reappear, they would typically look like:
 * "Animated: `useNativeDriver` is not supported because the native animated module is missing"
