  - Migrated all 10+ modules to use catalog aliases
  - Eliminated hardcoded versions across the entire project
  - Established bundles for common dependency groups (compose-ui, room, networking, etc.)

#### Dependency Injection Architecture
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Hilt Enabled)
- **Achievement**: Modern DI framework integrated
- **Details**:
  - Hilt dependency injection fully configured and working
  - Application class annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`
  - ViewModels using `@HiltViewModel` with constructor injection
  - Modular DI setup with database, repository, and use case modules

#### Build System Modernization
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Achievement**: Streamlined and consistent build configuration
- **Details**:
  - All modules using version catalog references
  - Consistent plugin application across modules
  - Modern Kotlin 2.2.20 and Compose compiler configuration
  - Build successfully compiles and assembles APK

- **Achievement**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **Details**:
  - `MainActivity` with proper Compose integration
  - `LibraryScreen` with stateless composables
  - Material Design 3 theming
  - Working ViewModel injection and state observation

#### Source System Architecture
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Achievement**: Extensible source pattern for content providers
- **Details**:
  - `Source` interface defining extension contract
  - `LocalSource` implementation as example
  - Integration with use cases and dependency injection
  - Foundation for future online sources (MangaDex, etc.)
