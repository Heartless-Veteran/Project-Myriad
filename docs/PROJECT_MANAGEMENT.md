# Enhanced Project Management Automation

This document describes the enhanced project management automation system implemented for Project Myriad.

## 🎯 Overview

The enhanced project management automation provides intelligent GitHub Projects integration with automatic labeling, milestone assignment, status tracking, and workflow optimization.

## ✨ Features

### 🏷️ Intelligent Auto-Labeling
- **File-based labeling**: Automatically applies labels based on changed file paths
- **Architecture-aware**: Recognizes Kotlin architecture patterns (ViewModel, Repository, DAO, Entity)
- **Technology detection**: Identifies Android, Kotlin, UI, build, and configuration changes
- **Documentation tracking**: Automatically labels documentation updates

### 🎯 Smart Milestone Assignment
- **Priority-based**: Critical bugs and security issues → Foundation milestone
- **Feature categorization**: AI features → AI Integration, Core features → Core Features
- **Content analysis**: Analyzes issue/PR titles and descriptions for intelligent assignment

### 📊 Automated Status Tracking
- **Issue lifecycle**: `To Do` → `In Progress` (when assigned) → `Done` (when closed)
- **PR workflow**: `In Review` → `In Progress` (when draft) → `Done` (when merged)
- **Project columns**: Automatically moves items between project board columns

### 🔄 Event-Driven Automation
Responds to various GitHub events:
- Issue: opened, closed, reopened, assigned, labeled, milestoned
- PR: opened, closed, ready_for_review, converted_to_draft, labeled
- PR Reviews: submitted

## 🏗️ Configuration

### Project Columns
- **To Do**: New issues and reopened items
- **In Progress**: Assigned issues and draft PRs
- **In Review**: Open PRs ready for review
- **Done**: Completed issues and merged PRs
- **Released**: Items included in releases

### Milestones
- **v1.0.0 - Foundation**: Critical bugs, documentation, CI/CD, build
- **v1.1.0 - Core Features**: Main application features (Vault, Reader)
- **v1.2.0 - AI Integration**: AI Core, OCR, translation features
- **v1.3.0 - Polish & UX**: UI improvements and user experience

### Auto-Labeling Rules
```javascript
{
  'docs/': ['documentation'],
  '.github/workflows/': ['ci/cd', 'automation'],
  'app/src/main/kotlin/': ['android', 'kotlin'],
  'scripts/': ['automation'],
  'build.gradle': ['build'],
  'app/src/test/': ['testing'],
  'config/': ['configuration']
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Automatic Operation
The system runs automatically on:
- New issues and PRs
- Status changes (assignment, closing, reopening)
- Label changes
- Milestone changes
- PR state changes (draft/ready)

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test project management automation
npm run project-manager

# Test within workflow
npm run test-workflow
```

### Workflow Integration
The automation is integrated into `.github/workflows/project-management.yml` and runs on all relevant GitHub events.

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Run project manager tests
npm run test-project-manager

# Test specific scenarios
node scripts/project-manager.js
```

### Test Scenarios
1. **Auto-labeling**: Tests file path analysis and label suggestions
2. **Milestone assignment**: Tests priority-based and content-based assignment
3. **Status tracking**: Tests issue/PR lifecycle management
4. **Integration**: Tests with sample GitHub events

## 📈 Benefits

### For Development Team
- **Reduced manual work**: Automatic project organization
- **Consistent labeling**: Standardized categorization across all items
- **Clear progress tracking**: Visual status updates on project board
- **Priority management**: Automatic milestone and priority assignment

### For Project Management
- **Real-time visibility**: Always up-to-date project status
- **Intelligent organization**: Smart categorization based on content and changes
- **Workflow optimization**: Streamlined issue and PR processing
- **Quality assurance**: Consistent project structure and documentation

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Labels
Edit the `labelMappings` configuration in `scripts/project-manager.js`:
```javascript
labelMappings: {
  'new/path/': ['new-label'],
  // ... existing mappings
}
```

### Modifying Milestones
Update the `milestones` configuration:
```javascript
milestones: {
  newMilestone: 'v2.0.0 - New Feature Set',
  // ... existing milestones
}
```

### Custom Status Logic
Modify the `determineStatus()` method to implement custom status determination logic.

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Reports
The system generates detailed reports available at:
- `project-management-report.json`: Configuration and test results
- GitHub Actions logs: Real-time automation activity

### Metrics
- Auto-labeling accuracy
- Milestone assignment effectiveness
- Status transition patterns
- Processing time and efficiency

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Dependency tracking**: Link issues to code dependencies
- **Automated testing**: Trigger tests based on changed components
- **Release automation**: Automatic release preparation
- **Analytics dashboard**: Project health and progress metrics

### Integration Opportunities
- **Code quality metrics**: Link code quality to project status
- **CI/CD integration**: Status updates based on build results
- **Documentation sync**: Keep docs in sync with project status
- **External tools**: Integration with design tools and project management platforms
