**Manual Usage**:
```yaml
# Go to Actions → Build APK → Run workflow
# Select:
# - Build type: debug/staging/release
# - Create bundle: true/false
# - Upload artifacts: true/false
# - Skip build errors: true/false (for rapid iteration)
```

### 2. Quick APK Build (`quick-apk-build.yml`)
**Fast APK builds** optimized for testing the completed application:

- **Triggers**: Manual dispatch only
- **Features**:

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Build Debug APK of Complete App
```bash
# Local build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# GitHub Actions - Quick Build
Actions → Quick APK Build → Run workflow → Build
```

### 2. Build Complete App with Bundle
```bash
# Local build
./gradlew assembleDebug bundleDebug

# GitHub Actions - Full Build
Actions → Build APK → Run workflow → Select "Create bundle: true"
```

### 3. Create Release for Testing
```bash
# GitHub Actions - Quick Build with Release
Actions → Quick APK Build → Run workflow → Enable "Upload to release"
```

## 📋 Workflow Comparison

| Feature | Build APK | Quick APK Build |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Comprehensive builds | Fast iteration |
| **Build Time** | 25-35 minutes | 15-20 minutes |
| **Error Handling** | Advanced validation | Auto-fix compilation |
| **Build Types** | Debug/Staging/Release | Debug only |
| **AAB Generation** | ✅ Optional | ❌ |
| **GitHub Releases** | ❌ | ✅ Optional |
| **Artifact Upload** | ✅ Always | ✅ Always |
| **Best For** | Final testing, releases | Development, hotfixes |

## 🔧 Configuration

### Version Management
Current app version in `app/build.gradle.kts`:
```kotlin
defaultConfig {
    versionCode = 2        // Increment for each release
    versionName = "1.0.1"  // Current stable version
}
```

### Build Optimization
The workflows are optimized for the completed application:
- **Memory**: 6GB heap for large project compilation
- **Caching**: Comprehensive Gradle dependency caching
- **Parallelization**: Multi-module build optimization
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of minor compilation issues

## 📊 Build Monitoring

### Artifact Retention
- **APKs/AABs**: 30 days (production testing)
- **Build Reports**: 7 days (debugging)
- **Quick Builds**: 30 days (extended testing)

### Build Status Tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: Real-time build monitoring
- **Artifacts**: Automatic upload with metadata
- **Releases**: Optional GitHub release creation
- **Summaries**: Detailed completion reports

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### Compilation Errors
The workflows include automatic fixes for common issues:
- Missing Material Icons → Replaced with available alternatives
- Import conflicts → Automatic import resolution
- Type mismatches → ViewModel type corrections

#### Memory Issues
```bash
# Increase heap size for local builds
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xmx6g -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m"
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

#### Build Performance
- Use Quick APK Build for rapid iteration
- Enable "skip_build_errors" for development builds
- Leverage Gradle cache for subsequent builds
