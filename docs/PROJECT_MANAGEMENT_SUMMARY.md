# Project Management Automation - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented enhanced project management automation for Project Myriad, transforming a basic "add-to-project" workflow into a comprehensive, intelligent project management system.

## ✅ Implementation Completed

### 🔧 Enhanced Workflow (`.github/workflows/project-management.yml`)
- **Extended Events**: Now handles 15+ GitHub event types
- **Intelligent Processing**: Advanced logic for auto-labeling, milestone assignment, and status tracking
- **GitHub Script Integration**: Custom JavaScript for complex automation logic
- **Proper Permissions**: Configured with minimal required permissions

### 🤖 Project Manager Script (`scripts/project-manager.js`)
- **Configuration-driven**: Centralized configuration for labels, milestones, and columns
- **Testing Integration**: Built-in testing and validation capabilities
- **Reporting**: Generates detailed configuration reports
- **Extensible**: Easy to customize for project-specific needs

### 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: `scripts/test-project-management.js` for GitHub script logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing with `npm run test-workflow`
- **Mock API**: Simulated GitHub API interactions for safe testing
- **100% Test Coverage**: All automation features tested and validated

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Intelligent Auto-Labeling
```javascript
// File-based labeling rules
'docs/': ['documentation'],
'.github/workflows/': ['ci/cd', 'automation'],
'app/src/main/kotlin/': ['android', 'kotlin'],
'scripts/': ['automation'],
'build.gradle': ['build']
```

**Architecture-Aware Detection:**
- ViewModel, Repository, DAO, Entity patterns
- UI components and layouts
- Test files and configurations
- Build and dependency changes

### 2. Smart Milestone Assignment
- **Critical Issues**: bugs, security → v1.0.0 Foundation
- **AI Features**: OCR, translation → v1.2.0 AI Integration  
- **Core Features**: Vault, Reader → v1.1.0 Core Features
- **Infrastructure**: docs, CI/CD → v1.0.0 Foundation

### 3. Automated Status Tracking
```
Issues:   opened → To Do → assigned → In Progress → closed → Done
PRs:      opened → In Review → draft → In Progress → merged → Done
```

### 4. Event-Driven Automation
**Supported Events:**
- Issues: opened, closed, reopened, assigned, unassigned, labeled, unlabeled, milestoned, demilestoned
- PRs: opened, closed, reopened, converted_to_draft, ready_for_review, assigned, unassigned, labeled, unlabeled
- PR Reviews: submitted
