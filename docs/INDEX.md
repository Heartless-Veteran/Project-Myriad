## ðŸ“– Documentation Principles

### Single Source of Truth
Each piece of information has a primary location to avoid duplication:

- **Architecture Details** â†’ **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)**
- **Development Setup** â†’ **[DEVELOPMENT.md](../DEVELOPMENT.md)**
- **Technical Requirements** â†’ **[requirements.md](requirements.md)**
- **Feature Overview** â†’ **[README.md](../README.md)**

### Cross-References
Documents reference each other rather than duplicating information:
- High-level overviews link to detailed documentation
- Detailed docs reference related concepts
- Clear navigation between related topics

### Audience-Specific Organization
- **README.md** - Accessible to all users, provides overview and navigation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical details for developers and architects
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Practical information for active contributors
- **requirements.md** - Comprehensive specifications for detailed analysis

## ðŸ”„ Maintenance
