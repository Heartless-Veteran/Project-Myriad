# Review Response: Mock Store Duplication

## Issue Addressed
**Review Comment:** The mock store creation is duplicated across multiple test files (AICoreScreen, LibraryScreen). Consider extracting this into a shared test utility to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Shared Test Utilities
**File:** `__tests__/utils/testUtils.tsx`

- **`createMockStore(initialState)`**: Centralized mock store creation with configurable initial state
- **`renderWithProvider(component, initialState)`**: Shared function for rendering Redux-connected components
- **`defaultMockState`**: Default mock state structure for consistent testing across components
- Supports all Redux slices: `ai`, `library`, and `settings`
- Handles library slice actions for proper async thunk testing

### 2. Updated Test Files

#### AICoreScreen.test.tsx
- Removed duplicated `createMockStore` and `renderWithProvider` functions
- Replaced `mockAiSlice.initialState` references with `defaultMockState.ai`
- Imported shared utilities from `../utils/testUtils`
- Reduced file size by ~60 lines of duplicated code

#### LibraryScreen.test.tsx
- Removed duplicated `createMockStore` and `renderWithProvider` functions
- Now uses shared utilities from `../utils/testUtils`
- Maintained all existing test functionality
- Reduced file size by ~50 lines of duplicated code

### 3. Created Shared Mock Components
**File:** `__tests__/utils/mockComponents.tsx`

- Reusable mock implementations for common components:
  - `mockButton()` - Button component mock
  - `mockCard()` - Card component mock
  - `mockContentList()` - ContentList component mock
  - `mockSearchBar()` - SearchBar component mock
  - `mockFilterPanel()` - FilterPanel component mock
- Consistent mock behavior across test files
- Ready for future use to reduce component mock duplication

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated `TEST_SUMMARY.md` to document the new test utilities
- Added section explaining shared test utilities and mock components
- Updated test running script to mention the new utilities

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated ~110 lines of duplicated mock store code
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Single source of truth for mock store configuration
3. **Consistency**: All Redux-connected tests now use the same mock store structure
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new slices or modify mock behavior in one place
5. **Reusability**: Mock components can be reused across multiple test files
6. **Better Test Organization**: Clear separation between test logic and test utilities

## Testing
All existing tests continue to pass with the new shared utilities. The behavior is identical to the previous implementation, but with better code organization and maintainability.
